# Inventory Examples

Ink's lists can be used in [many ways](https://github.com/inkle/ink/blob/master/Documentation/WritingWithInk.md#8-summary).
This repository contains several examples on how to use Ink's lists to implement an inventory :
- [inventory_with_LIST.ink](https://github.com/random-narratives/inventory_examples/blob/main/inventory_with_LIST.ink) : a first example using an immutable list (called a multi-valued list in Ink's documentation) 
- [inventory_with_VAR.ink](https://github.com/random-narratives/inventory_examples/blob/main/inventory_with_VAR.ink) : a second example using Inkâ€™s multi-list feature, which provides greater flexibility without increasing code complexity
- [inventory_with_multiple_states.ink](https://github.com/random-narratives/inventory_examples/blob/main/inventory_with_multiple_states.ink) : a third example using a multi-list per object to store states
